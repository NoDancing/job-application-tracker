.SH NAME
jobapp \- structured job application tracking CLI using SQLite
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f[B]jobapp\f[R] \f[I]command\f[R] [\f[I]options\f[R]]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f[B]jobapp\f[R] is a command\-line tool for managing job applications
using a local SQLite database.
It provides a structured, queryable alternative to spreadsheets,
enabling consistent tracking, automation, and integration with developer
workflows.
.PP
The tool enforces strict conventions for application status, priority,
sources, dates, and timeline events.
These conventions are designed to support reliable scripting and
LLM\-assisted command generation.
.PP
All data is stored locally in a single SQLite database file and requires
no external services.
.SH COMMANDS
.SS init
Initialize a new applications database in the current directory.
.IP
.EX
jobapp init
.EE
.PP
If the database already exists, the command will refuse to overwrite it.
